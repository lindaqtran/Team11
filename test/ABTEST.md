**A/B Test Name:** <br>
*Font Impact Test on User Adoption
**User Story Number:** <br>
*US4 <br>
**Metric (from the HEART grid)**: <br>
*Adoption: This will be measured by the rate of new user sign-ups, the completion rate of setting up profiles with dietary preferences and cooking skill levels, and the initial engagement with the "Discover Recipes" feature within the first session of app use. <br>
**Hypothesis:** <br>
*Changing the app's font from Merriweather to Oswald is hypothesized to improve readability and the overall aesthetic of the app, leading to a more positive first impression. This enhancement is expected to increase new user sign-ups and encourage more complete interactions with setting up profiles and engaging with the "Discover Recipes" feature, as the content appears more accessible and inviting.
**Experiment:** <br>
*Setup: Implement a 50/50 split where half of the new users see the app's text in Merriweather (Control Group A) and the other half see the text in Oswald (Experiment Group B). This test will be conducted over a period of 4 weeks.
*Audience: All new users during the test period.
*Tracking: Using Firebase Analytics, track sign-up rates, the number of profiles fully set up with preferences, and engagement metrics with the "Discover Recipes" feature between the two groups. <br>
**Variations:** <br>
*Control Variation (A): Use Merriweather font across the app. This variation will serve as the baseline for comparison.
*Experiment Variation (B): Use Oswald font across the app. The expectation is that this font will offer a cleaner and more modern look, potentially affecting user engagement positively.
**Design Mockups and Diagrams: <br>
*Prepare mockups showing key user journey touchpoints (e.g., sign-up page, profile setup, "Discover Recipes" feature) in both Merriweather and Oswald fonts. Highlight how Oswald might improve the user experience in terms of readability and aesthetic appeal, encouraging longer engagement sessions and a higher rate of profile completions.
