# Lean Canvas Business Plan

The Lean Canvas approach is a concise and efficient method for developing a business plan, popularized by entrepreneur and author Ash Maurya. Unlike traditional business plans, which can be lengthy and detailed, the Lean Canvas condenses key elements into a single page, focusing on essential aspects such as customer segments, problem-solution fit, unique value propositions, channels, revenue streams, cost structure, and key metrics. This approach fosters rapid iteration, allowing startups and businesses to quickly validate their ideas, adapt to changing market conditions, and iterate on their strategies.
