# Observation: 
Observation Statement: The survey results indicate a strong representation of young adults, particularly college-aged individuals, with 62.4% falling within the 18-24 age range. This skew towards college-aged respondents could be attributed to the survey's origins as a college-created survey, which likely facilitated easier access to college students. Despite this potential skew, the team chose to focus on respondents who demonstrated an interest in food and fell within the college-age or post-graduate demographic based on the survey responses.

Team Action: Given the focus on respondents interested in food and culinary activities, the team may continue to refine the app's features and content to cater to the preferences and needs of the predominantly college-aged demographic while ensuring inclusivity and engagement across all age groups. They may also consider strategies to reach a broader demographic of food enthusiasts beyond the college-aged population.

From our poll, our users have told us that they are mostly unsure of whether they would participate in discussions. However, since more users that said that they would participate in discussions, we have decided to change our approach to the way that discussions are held. Instead of having dedicated areas for disusion, we will include comments on recipes so that if users want to have discussions they have a space to do so.

Accourding to the results of the poll, we can see that 37% of users would be interested in recipes tailed to their deitary preferences. Because of this, our team is going to add a search criteria that encorporates such deitary needs. For example, if users are gluten free, than we will include a search criteria to only show gluten free recipes.

# Observation
Observation Statement: Feedback from potential users highlighted concerns regarding the use of the word "connect" in the platform name, expressing associations with overuse and corporate vibes. Additionally, there were suggestions to focus more on the aspect of recipes and cooking rather than a generic term like "connect." Users also expressed that the term "culinary" might make the app feel too fancy or intimidating for average cooks, while others suggested variations like "Culinary Connections" for a more social emphasis. Furthermore, there were comments regarding the length of the original name, with suggestions that shorter names are more effective, akin to major social media sites.

Team Action: Based on the feedback received, the team decided to change the platform name to "Tastebuds." This name addresses the concerns about the term "connect" while still emphasizing the social aspect of the app. It also aligns more closely with the focus on recipes and cooking, as suggested by users. Additionally, "Tastebuds" is shorter and more concise, addressing concerns about name length and aligning with the preference for shorter names akin to major social media platforms.
