# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official email address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Decisions

In cases where conflicting opinions arise, the group will resort to a voting system involving all 5 members to reach a conclusive solution. This ensures that decisions are made collectively and fairly, taking into account the diverse perspectives within the group. 

## Attendance 

To maintain the integrity and commitment of the group, a policy is in place where missing 5 consecutive meetings prompts the remaining members to convene and determine the fate of the absentee. This mechanism ensures accountability and ensures that the group remains cohesive and productive.

## Assignments 

Assignments will be distributed based on volunteerism, allowing members to choose tasks that align with their interests and strengths. Regular progress check-ins during meetings will ensure that everyone stays on track, and support will be provided to those who require assistance, fostering collaboration and maximizing productivity.


## Meetings

Meetings are scheduled twice weekly, with punctuality and preparedness expected from all members to foster effective collaboration. Active participation is encouraged, with members urged to contribute according to their abilities and offer constructive feedback. This approach promotes a productive and inclusive environment, enhancing the group's overall performance and cohesion. During meetings, please refrain from using or having your phones out. It is important to maintain focus and active participation without distractions from electronic devices. Let's ensure a productive and respectful environment for everyone involved.No phone during meeting.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the Professor and TA's.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

sustained inappropriate behavior.
